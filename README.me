# QykSwipe - A new way to browse Instagram - iOS

### What is QykSwipe?

"QykSwipe" is a new way to browse instagram. It is an iOS application that utilizes the open Instagram API to create a fun photo competition. Users are presented with two photos at a time, and they simply swipe on the photo that appeals to them the most. The user can choose to only be shown their friendâ€™s photos, explore other photos, or they can search by hashtag. Users earn points by swiping their favourite pictures and when their posted pictures are liked by other users. A leaderboard tracks the user's with the most amount of points. Additionally, Kiip (http://www.kiip.me/) has been integrated to provide rewards to users when they reach certain score or levels.
